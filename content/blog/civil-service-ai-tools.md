summary: "I built a STAR interview generator, a CV matcher, and a downloadable Flask app to help candidates succeed."

I’ve spent a lot of time studying how Civil Service hiring works — STAR, Behaviours, sift checks, Success Profiles, scoring frameworks.  
Then I realised something:

**AI can help people navigate this better than anything currently available.**

So I built:

### 1️⃣ Civil Service Interview Assistant
- Generates STAR answers  
- Tailored to specific behaviours  
- Includes ‘what good looks like’ patterns  
- Helps users break down their own experience  

### 2️⃣ Civil Service Job Matcher (Downloadable App)
This tool:

- reads the user's CV  
- parses job listings  
- identifies behaviour gaps  
- suggests evidence  
- writes STAR drafts  

It’s packaged as a standalone Flask app users can download directly from my site.

### 3️⃣ Civil Service Job Matcher Web Version
A browser-based experience using the same logic.

### Why it matters
I want to help people get jobs they normally find impossible to access.  
This has been one of the most meaningful projects I’ve built.
