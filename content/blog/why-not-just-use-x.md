We’re in a weird moment where every day there’s a new AI SaaS tool claiming to:

- build agents  
- build chatbots  
- build workflows  
- build entire startups  

So what’s the real answer?

## 🧨 1. SaaS Tools Are Great… Until They Aren’t
They are:
- convenient  
- quick  
- shiny  
- easy to demo  
- great for prototypes  

But they **flatten your skillset**.

## 💀 2. SaaS Tools Die Constantly
Startups shut down.  
APIs break.  
Models change.  
Pricing spikes.  
Limits appear.  

If your system depends on them, you’re trapped.

## 🤖 3. SaaS Tools Make You a User  
Not a builder.

If you want:
- mastery  
- control  
- speed  
- freedom  
- customisation  
- long-term ownership  

…you need your own code.

## 💪 4. What Real Builders Do
They use SaaS tools for:
- validation  
- quick testing  
- reference UX  

Then build **their own architecture**.

Like what we’ve done with Bob + Chad:
- planner  
- tools  
- jail  
- self-repair  
- Python-first control  

That’s something no SaaS tool can replicate.

## 🚀 5. When SaaS Tools ARE worth using
- Notion AI (quick drafting)
- Perplexity (research assistant)
- Replit Agent (isolated execution)
- LM Studio (local inference)
- HuggingFace Inference (quick model tests)

But the goal is always the same:

**Learn enough to outgrow them.**
