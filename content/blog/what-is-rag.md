summary: "RAG is one of the most important AI patterns. Here’s the clearest, no-nonsense explanation of how it works."

RAG is everywhere in modern AI systems.  
But most explanations are so abstract they're useless.

Here’s the simple version:

## 🧠 1. LLMs are smart, but forget everything
They don’t know:
- your documents  
- your code  
- your data  
- your knowledge base  

RAG fixes this.

## 🔍 2. Retrieval finds the relevant information
Before the LLM answers, the system:
- searches a vector database  
- finds relevant chunks  
- injects them into the prompt  

This gives the LLM **facts**.

## 🧩 3. Augmentation = Adding context
RAG expands the model’s world.

Instead of:
> “Write a summary.”

You give:
> “Write a summary using *these documents*.”

Now the model stops hallucinating.

## 📚 4. RAG powers:
- document chat  
- FAQ bots  
- policy compliance systems  
- knowledge assistants  
- internal team tools  

Even GhostFrog could eventually use RAG for classified product notes.

## 🚀 5. Why RAG matters
A chatbot is dumb.  
A chatbot with your documents is **useful**.
