title: "Learning AI Engineering by Doing: My 6-Month Journey"
date: "2025-11-20"
summary: "I stopped reading tutorials and started building real systems — and the results changed everything."
---

Six months ago I wouldn’t have called myself an “AI engineer”.

Today I’ve built:

- a self-improving agentic system (Bob + Chad)
- a data-driven arbitrage engine (GhostFrog)
- a full Civil Service AI toolkit
- a Flask portfolio full of working apps
- local LLM pipelines using Ollama
- an entire developer workflow powered by autonomous tools

### What changed?
I stopped learning *theory*.  
I started shipping *projects that matter to me*.

The breakthrough was realising that:

- Python skills grow fastest when you build end-to-end systems  
- Agentic patterns (planner → tools → executor) create insane productivity  
- Local models (phi, qwen) outperform cloud LLMs for iterative coding  
- Every mistake becomes a learning rule for the systsoem  

### The Big Outcome
I now feel genuinely ready to apply for Python developer roles — including UK Civil Service SEO/G7 roles.

I built my own *evidence* instead of reading books.

This blog will track the next stage of the journey.
