                        Whether you're applying for SEO, G7, or other grades, the Civil Service interview process
                        revolves around behavioural questions.
                        Our assistant uses AI to help you structure your experience using the STAR method:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Situation:</strong> What was the background or context?</li>
                        <li><strong>Task:</strong> What were you trying to achieve?</li>
                        <li><strong>Action:</strong> What did <em>you</em> specifically do?</li>
                        <li><strong>Result:</strong> What was the outcome or impact?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mt-3">
                        Just enter the behaviour (e.g. “Leadership”), a short scenario prompt, and a few lines about
                        your experience — and the assistant will write the rest.
