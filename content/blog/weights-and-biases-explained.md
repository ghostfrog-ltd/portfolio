If you browse any serious ML repo, you’ll see:

import wandb


So what does Weights & Biases actually do?

## 🚀 It's Experiment Tracking
Think of W&B as GitHub for training runs.

It stores:
- configs  
- hyperparameters  
- logs  
- metrics  
- losses  
- validation accuracy  

And **lets you compare them visually**.

## 🧠 Why It’s Critical
Training ML models is basically:
- tweak something  
- run the model  
- monitor  
- compare  
- repeat  

Without experiment tracking, you’re blind.

## 🧬 W&B Helps With:
- fine-tuning  
- reinforcement learning  
- evaluation  
- dataset versioning  
- model artefact storage  

It’s like a flight dashboard for your model.

## ❗ Should YOU Learn It?
Not required for:
- agent systems  
- RAG apps  
- chatbots  
- small tools  

BUT extremely useful when:
- fine-tuning  
- experimenting with embeddings  
- benchmarking models  

If you ever go deeper into custom ML, W&B becomes your best friend.
