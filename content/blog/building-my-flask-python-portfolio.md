title: "Building My Python + Flask Portfolio While Learning Publicly"
date: "2025-11-24"
summary: "I built my portfolio by stacking real tools, not tutorial projects. Everything deployed, everything usable."

Most people build side projects that never ship.  
I went the other way — I shipped everything.

I built my Flask portfolio to act as:

- a living CV  
- a demo platform for AI tools  
- a place to show real users what I’m building  
- a hub for projects like the Translator, Interview Assistant, and Job Matcher  

### What I built
- A modular Flask architecture using Blueprints  
- Download endpoints for standalone apps  
- SMTP email handlers  
- A professional landing page  
- An eBay webhook endpoint  
- Clean URLs for projects  
- A real user workflow (no placeholders)

This portfolio site runs the same style of backend architecture I use professionally — blueprints, helpers, separation of concerns, and scalable structure.

It’s my home base for everything I’m building.
